## About the game

Into the Function is a captivating roguelike card game that immerses players in the world of coding. It is heavily inspired by the game Slay the Spire from Mega Crit Games.

In this strategic adventure, players collect and utilize programming-themed cards to navigate procedurally generated levels, overcome challenging enemies, and strategize to defeat the boss. 

Each decision and card played alters the path, requiring a blend of logic and strategy to succeed. Dive into the digital realm, optimize your deck, and utilize every effect, function, and variable cards to conquer enemies and emerge victorious!

## What I worked on
In this project I mostly worked on the database UI system. The database contains a list of all cards in the game and tutorials. I made sure the database is generated automatically by reading data from the project folders. The content of the tutorials are also editable in the inspector window and stored in a list for dynamic UI content.

I also took part in developing the map generator. The map uses a graph tree in which the player can traverse through the nodes. I created an algorithm to remove all isolated node generated by the tree to ensure that players cannot find themselves in a dead end.

## Game controls
Note : as this game mainly uses click controls, no keybinds are used in the game

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `MapGenerator.cs` | Generates a node-based map by creating a tree and then removing all isolated nodes from the tree. |
| `CollectionManager.cs`  | Loads every card from the project folder and generates a list of the cards. |
| `CollectionItemHolder.cs`  | Stores the card component and its sprite. |
| `CollectionMenu.cs`  | Dynamically generates the collection content (cards list) and game tutorials into UI format. |
